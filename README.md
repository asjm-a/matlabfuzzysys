# matlabfuzzysys
This MATLAB code is designed to implement a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) for the prediction of vehicle speed based on key input parameters, including Traffic Density, Road Condition, Speed Limit, and Weather. Here's a breakdown of the essential components:

Initialization and Configuration:
The code begins by initializing a FIS named 'Vehicle Speed' and configuring input and output variables with associated membership functions. The rule base is established with 27 predefined rules, providing a solid foundation for context-aware speed predictions.

Example Evaluation:
To showcase the system's functionality, example input values are supplied. The FIS is then evaluated, producing a predicted vehicle speed. This demonstration illustrates the system's capability to make informed speed decisions based on input conditions.

Data Handling:
The code incorporates a mechanism for creating and managing sample data. This data, along with the associated output, is stored in an Excel file ('speed_data.xlsx'). Visualization tools are employed to illustrate membership functions and the rule base, enhancing understanding and adaptability.

Excel File Management:
Efficient Excel file handling is a key feature. The code ensures the creation and updating of an Excel file, capturing output data for further analysis or integration into other systems. This functionality enhances the practical usability of the FIS in real-world scenarios.

This FIS implementation provides a concise and adaptable solution for predicting vehicle speed, making it well-suited for integration into intelligent transportation systems. Its clear structure and emphasis on real-world applicability make it a valuable asset for diverse applications in the automotive industry.
